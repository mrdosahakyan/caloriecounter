**IMPORTANT STATEMENT**

Generally, if you do not meet the conditions of our Money-Back Guarantee Policy set out above, the fees you have paid are non-refundable or non-exchangeable unless otherwise stated herein or as required by applicable law. Moreover, we may consider specific refund requests on a case-by-case basis and grant them at our sole discretion.

**Note for the EU residents:**

If you are a consumer based in the EEA or Switzerland, when you make a purchase of a single item of digital content (such as PDF file, video and so on), you expressly agree that such content is made available to you immediately. As a result, you forfeit your right of withdrawal and will not be eligible for a refund. By signing up for our service, which is not a single item of digital content and is provided on a continuous basis (such as subscriptions to the app), you expressly request and consent to an immediate supply of such service.If you are an EEA or Switzerland resident, you have the right to withdraw from the agreement for purchase of digital content without charge and without giving any reason within fourteen (14) days from the date of such agreement conclusion. The withdrawal right does not apply if the performance of the agreement has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal. Therefore, if you exercise your right of withdrawal, we will deduct from your refund an amount that is proportionate to the service provided before you communicated your withdrawal from the contract. If you have not forfeited your right of withdrawal, the withdrawal period will conclude 14 days after you enter into the contract. To initiate your right of withdrawal, you must notify us within this 14-day period. Therefore, you will only be eligible for a refund if the digital content is defective.  
<br/>YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE IMMEDIATE PERFORMANCE OF THE AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE AGREEMENT ONCE OUR SERVERS VALIDATE YOUR PURCHASE AND YOU SUCCESSFULLY RECEIVE THE APPLICABLE PURCHASE.

**Note for residents of certain US states:**  If you reside in California or Connecticut and cancel the purchase at any time before midnight of the third business day after the purchase date, we will return the payment you made.
